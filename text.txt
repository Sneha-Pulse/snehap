Hey there! I'm Sneha, a postgraduate student currently pursuing my master's in science, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

Storytelling, data, and design are my jam, so I thought, why not combine them all? This portfolio is where it all comes togetherâ€”my love for design, frontend development, and diving into the latest AI technologies. Take a look around and enjoy!
